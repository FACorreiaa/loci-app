### Make sure you are on the main branch
git checkout main

### Create the new branch from the current state of main
git branch legacy-rest-monolith

# Create go vendor 

There are two primary, modern strategies for handling this in Go:

1.  **Go Workspaces (Recommended for Local Development):** The idiomatic and most powerful way to manage multiple related Go modules locally.
2.  **A Shared `vendor` Directory (The "Monorepo" Approach):** A more traditional but still effective method, especially if you want to commit all dependencies to a single repository.

You would typically **not** have a separate `vendor` directory *inside each microservice*. That would lead to massive duplication and a maintenance nightmare.

Let's break down both strategies.

### Strategy 1: Go Workspaces (The Modern, Recommended Approach)

Go Workspaces were introduced in Go 1.18 specifically to solve this problem. A workspace allows you to treat multiple Go modules as if they are part of a single "workspace," making it seamless to edit and build them together without needing `replace` directives or a `vendor` directory.

**How it Works:**

*   You create a `go.work` file at the root of your project.
*   This file tells the Go toolchain which local modules are part of your workspace.
*   When you are inside the workspace, `go build`, `go run`, and your IDE will automatically use the local source code of your microservices instead of fetching them from a remote repository.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1.  **Structure Your Project:** Organize your microservices as separate modules in a common parent directory.

    ```
    /my-project/
    ├── go.work             <-- The workspace file you will create
    ├── services/
    │   ├── users-auth/
    │   │   ├── main.go
    │   │   └── go.mod      <-- module my-project/users-auth
    │   ├── users-payment/
    │   │   ├── main.go
    │   │   └── go.mod      <-- module my-project/users-payment
    │   ├── chat/
    │   │   ├── main.go
    │   │   └── go.mod      <-- module my-project/chat
    │   └── pois/
    │       ├── main.go
    │       └── go.mod      <-- module my-project/pois
    └── internal/
        └── shared-lib/     <-- A shared library (e.g., for types, db connections)
            ├── types.go
            └── go.mod      <-- module my-project/internal/shared-lib
    ```

2.  **Initialize the Workspace:** Navigate to the root of your project and use the `go work init` command to add your modules.

    ```bash
    cd /my-project/
    go work init ./services/users-auth ./services/users-payment ./services/chat ./services/pois ./internal/shared-lib
    ```
    This creates a `go.work` file that looks like this:

    ```
    go 1.22

    use (
        ./services/users-auth
        ./services/users-payment
        ./services/chat
        ./services/pois
        ./internal/shared-lib
    )
    ```

3.  **Work Seamlessly:** Now, you can work on your project as if it were one.
    *   If your `chat` service needs to import the `shared-lib`, its `go.mod` file would have a `require my-project/internal/shared-lib v0.0.0`.
    *   When you are in the `/my-project/` directory (or any subdirectory), the Go toolchain sees the `go.work` file and resolves that import to your local `./internal/shared-lib` directory automatically.
    *   You can build a specific service from the root: `go build ./services/users-auth`.

**Advantages of Go Workspaces:**

*   **No `vendor` directory needed for local development.**
*   **No `replace` directives needed in your `go.mod` files.** This keeps your `go.mod` files clean for production builds.
*   **IDE Integration:** Modern Go IDEs (like VS Code with the Go extension and Goland) understand `go.work` files and provide a seamless development experience.
*   **CI/CD:** For your production builds in a CI/CD pipeline, you can still use a vendoring step if desired, but for local development, workspaces are superior.

### Strategy 2: The "Monorepo" with a Shared `vendor` Directory

If you prefer to have all your code and all its dependencies checked into a single repository (a "monorepo"), you can use a single, top-level `vendor` directory.

**How it Works:**

*   You have a single `go.mod` file at the root of your entire project.
*   All your microservices are treated as simple packages *within* this single Go module.
*   You have one `vendor` directory at the root that serves all the packages.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1.  **Structure Your Project:**

    ```
    /my-project/
    ├── go.mod              <-- The *only* go.mod file
    ├── go.sum
    ├── vendor/             <-- The *only* vendor directory
    ├── cmd/                <-- Directory for your main applications
    │   ├── users-auth/
    │   │   └── main.go     <-- package main
    │   ├── users-payment/
    │   │   └── main.go     <-- package main
    │   ├── chat/
    │   │   └── main.go     <-- package main
    │   └── pois/
    │       └── main.go     <-- package main
    └── internal/
        └── shared/         <-- Your shared library code (e.g., package shared)
            └── types.go
    ```
    Your root `go.mod` would define the module path: `module my-project`.

2.  **Importing Shared Code:** The `main.go` file inside `cmd/users-auth/` would import the shared code using the module path: `import "my-project/internal/shared"`.

3.  **Managing Vendors:**
    *   You run `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor` from the **root** of the project (`/my-project/`).
    *   This single `vendor` directory will contain all external dependencies for all your microservices.

4.  **Building Services:** You build each service by specifying its path.
    ```bash
    # From the root /my-project/
    go build -mod=vendor ./cmd/users-auth
    ```

**Advantages of this approach:**

*   **Atomic Commits:** Changes across multiple services can be made in a single commit.
*   **Simplified Dependency Management:** There's only one set of dependencies to manage for the entire project.
*   **Guaranteed Consistency:** All services are guaranteed to be using the exact same version of every dependency.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Less Flexible:** All services are tied to the same dependency versions. Updating a library for one service might force you to update and re-test all other services.
*   **Scalability:** Can become cumbersome in very large projects with many teams.

### Recommendation

For your use case, **start with Go Workspaces (Strategy 1)**.

It is the modern, idiomatic Go way to handle this situation. It gives you the flexibility of having separate `go.mod` files for each service (allowing them to have slightly different dependencies if needed) while providing a frictionless local development experience. It's the best of both worlds and is what the Go team designed workspaces for.
